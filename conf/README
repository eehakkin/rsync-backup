The conf/pre.d directory
========================

An optional directory containing scripts which are executed in lexical
order of names by the backup-prepare(1) tool when preparing for backups.
The names of the files must consist of only characters matching the
pattern [[:alnum:]_.-].

The conf/purge-list file
========================

An optional file to override the default patterns and ages. The file
must contain operand lines having the following form:
    <PATTERN>=<DAYS>
These operands will be passed to the backup-purge(1) tool by the
backup(1) tool. Empty lines and comment lines (starting with a "#") are
allowed, too. Backup directories matching <PATTERN> are deleted if they
are over <DAYS> day old. Special patterns:
    yearly   [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]
             (for <YEAR>)
    monthly  [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]
             (for <YEAR><MONTH> and <YEAR>-<MONTH>)
    weekly   [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]W[0-9][0-9]
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-W[0-9][0-9]
             (for <YEAR>W<WEEK> and <YEAR>-W<WEEK>)
    daily    [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]W[0-9][0-9][0-9]
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-W[0-9][0-9]-[0-9]
             (for <YEAR><MONTH><DAY>, <YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DAY>,
             <YEAR>W<WEEK><DAY> and <YEAR>-W<WEEK>-<DAY>)
    hourly   [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]T[0-9][0-9]*
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]T[0-9][0-9]*
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]W[0-9][0-9][0-9]T[0-9][0-9]*
             [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-W[0-9][0-9]-[0-9]T[0-9][0-9]*
             (for <YEAR><MONTH><DAY>T<HOUR>*, <YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DAY>T<HOUR>*,
             <YEAR>W<WEEK><DAY>T<HOUR>* and <YEAR>-W<WEEK>-<DAY>T<HOUR>*)

The conf/rsh file
=================

An optional script to be used as a remote shell instead of the plain
ssh(1). This script can be used for setting identity files and proxy
commands, for instance.

The conf/src-list file
======================

A file to specify the sources to be used when creating backups. The file
must contain operand lines having the following form:
    [[<USER>@]<HOST>:]<SRC>
These operands will be passed to the backup-create(1) tool by the
backup(1) tool. Empty lines and comment lines (starting with a "#") are
allowed, too.

The conf/tag-formats file
=========================

An optional file containing date formats to be used by the
backup-create(1) tool when constructing backup directory names for
backups. Empty lines and comment lines (starting with a "#") are
allowed, too. Each date format is tried in turn in order specified until
a non-existing backup directory is found.
